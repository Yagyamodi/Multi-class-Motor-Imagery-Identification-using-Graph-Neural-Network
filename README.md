# Multi-class-Motor-Imagery-Identification-using-Graph-Neural-Network

Abstract —Brain Component Interface acquires brain signals,
analyzes them, and translates them into commands that are
relayed to an output device to carry out a desired action. It is one
of the most important field of study in today’s environment. Not
only it helps the people with disabled body function but is also
helps the human brain to connect with human made components.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is an efficient modality which
helps to acquire brain signals corresponds to various states from
the scalp surface area. This helps in understanding various brain
states and convert them into machine understandable format.
Our project highlights on the multi-class identification of EEGsignals via the Graph Neural Networks(GNNs). We will convert
our EEG signals into graph objects and compute their similarity
via multilayered neural networks for final identification of input
data.
